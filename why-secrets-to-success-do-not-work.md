# Why secrets to success don't work
There is a lot of content on how to be successful.

There are issues
 1. the definition of success is subjective
	- lets focus on finanicial success. Whether that brings happiness is up for debate

 2. there is no objective solution to the problem of success. Its like asking a successful chess player whats the best chess move. There is only the best move for a given situation. It depends on the board configuration, your opponent and yourself.

 3. there are some common aspects between people, but they are at such a high level it leaves a lot of details left to the individual to figure it. Its not just open the playbook and go.

 Resolutions
 - find people who are successful who are similiar to you in skills, background, peronality, ect.

 - Understand the common aspects of success, but know they won't help unless you can fill in the details of how it applies to you. Think and grow rich (> 5 on the list, not sure about, need to add action)

 - Realize someones steps to success could actually be your path to ruin. Eg. old narratives of no plan B, whole life savings into it. Fits for certain peronality types and certain situations (ex: family can support you if you fail)

 - understand survivorship bias and try to learn to identify it in the content you consume. Otherwise it can lead you astray.

 - You probably have to like some part of the process. You may spend a decent piece of your life in pursuit of success. Life is short, make sure you are enjoying the journey. Also will make it less likely you give up, get burnt out, or fail because you need breaks.

 - Understand the people involved in your success (yourself, strenghts/weaknesses, your competition/opponents, your close friends/family, mentors/network) and where you are at in life (your knowledge, your environment, your skills, your capital/resources)
    - I put people in to buckets. Will help with success or will not help
