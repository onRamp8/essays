# How to stay relevant in a constantly changing world

The world changes fast, its hard to keep up, especially over a sustained 
period of time. I became a productive member of society from university 
education (4 year bachelors degree plus two year masters degree). Which 
was a lot of effort and time. After which I was more or less on my own to 
stay up to date and remain relevant. 

This is where things can go wrong. We are at a point where the pace of 
change in industry has outpaced what the education system can provide. And 
even if the education system gets us there, it doesn’t keep us there. 
Without continual learning we are at risk to both market and technological 
change. These changes can render us less effective at best and jobless at 
worst. 

The most popular approach to this problem is to go through periodic 
training such as boot camps and certifications (from MOOCs for example). 
Whatever form that takes I believe it requires more effort and time than 
can be sustained over a career. This approach also models someone’s growth 
in terms of discrete points. During these periods of training we 
still need income, which means the training comes at the expense of our 
nights and weekends. It is more sustainable to use solutions that rely on 
continuous change instead of periodic discrete changes.

So here is an experiment to continually and organically stay up to date by 
breaking yourself down into the tasks you accomplish.
1. Brake up your work into the tasks you complete. This maybe daily or 
weekly.
2. Rank the tasks based on the amount of value they provide
3. Break down the tasks of the roles you want to be in. Or your same role 
in a company you want to be in. Or ask someone you admire to break down 
some of their tasks
4. Start rotating in tasks from the list in #3 into your queue and 
rotating out the low value tasks from #2.
(I use Jira to store and analyze the tasks but excel or other tools could 
probably work as well.)

For example I try not to see myself as a software engineer or an 
engineering manager, but as someone who did the following:
- Write a fault tolerant Kafka based messaging service 
- Improve the existing design of the flow of FIX based trade data to 
clearing systems
- design for concurrent, low latency messaging for banking customers
- Run tests for tag value based trading system
- Decide if we should hire developer X on the team
- Decide who from my team would benefit from working on task X
- Write up explanations of how code works for regulators

The list goes on, but looking at the most frequent or most impactful tasks 
on a weekly basis is a better way to view your role. And understand what 
you should do more or less of. This task list will change rapidly just as 
your view of your role should. And each week, month, quarter, you should 
be rotating new challenging high value tasks in and other tasks out.

The problem with the current work structure is we define our jobs and our 
identities by the role we perform. For example when you meet someone new 
the first question that is asked is what do you do for a living. The 
response is your job title. I’m a doctor, engineer, electrician, 
marketer. These labels get tied to our identity which strengthens the tie 
to the perception of the role. The role names don’t change and that 
lack of change can subtlety and destructively affect our perception. So 
don't use titles. Remove both titles and roles from your mental model of 
what you do, it will allow your perception of who you are to become fluid 
and constantly changing.
