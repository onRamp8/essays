# How to pick projects to work on in your job
If you work on 9-5 job avoid the trap many folks fall into by choicing a team or project based on prestige. For example many developers want to work on the most important systems in top tech companies. Here's why that is, in many cases not the best move for your career. Teams and systems that are mission critical are usually mature systems. Because successful companies will have put time and effort into maturing their mission critical system. These systems have several qualities that result in a bad risk reward ratio for your career. For example a mission critical system will be high risk to work on. If it goes down the company suffers, so you won't be as free to experiment. And if you do cause issues, the company will be less forgiving then a non cricial system. 

Compare that system with a team or system no one thinks will work. The risk reward ratio is way better. Everyone expects the team or system to fail, so if you do feel you are basically meeting expectations. No one is upset with you, the company is most likely not negatively affected because the failure of the thing is already baked into the quarterly and annual plans. However if it succeeds it will shock and awe the company and you will be the one who gets all the credit for doing the impossible. 

The hard part about this, and why I believe most don't do it is because its placing a bet on yourself and delaying gratification until you get a win. Most likely you will have several failures and no one will be impressed with you. Versus what most do is working on a prestigice project in the beginng, get some gratification, and you can brag about yourself. But ultimately you sacrifice long term growth. Once you get a win you have 2-10x the gratification and growth you would have picking a mature team or system. 

So join some failing projects, some struggling teams, turn them around and watch your career soar.
