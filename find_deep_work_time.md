# How free your time for deep work
Number one complaint I hear from software engineers is too many meetings. Can’t do any deep work because of standups and constant distractions. Here is what you 
can do about it. 
* Batch your meetings.
  * Push all your meetings to be one after another, it’s intense but is worth the trade off to free up the rest of your day.
* Block off time in your calendar for deep work. 
  * Maybe 2-4pm or 8am-10am or whatever time you do your best work. As an engineer your deep work is the 
  most high value task you do, pick the best time of day for you to do it. 

* Delegate up. 
  * Don’t think you could convince other teams, project managers and executives to move meetings to accommodate batching or deep work. Delegate the task up to your manager, they 
  got into ppl management to deal with this stuff. Ask them for help.  
  * Don’t think your manager would do this, find one that will. You’re career and your mental health will thank you.
